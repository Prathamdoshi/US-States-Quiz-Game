## How to Play
1. Once you start the game, you'll see an empty map of the United States.

2. Your goal is to guess the names of all 50 states. To make a guess, simply type the name of a state and press Enter.

3. If your guess is correct, the state will appear on the map, and your score will increase.

4. If your guess is incorrect, you'll receive a message informing you that the guess was wrong, and your score won't change.

5. Keep guessing until you've correctly identified all 50 states or decide to exit the game.

6. To exit the game, simply type "exit" and press Enter.

7. Your final score and the time it took to complete the game will be displayed.

Have fun and challenge your friends to see who can guess all 50 states the fastest!
